THE PROCESS:

I created a colour sensor that outputs colour on a Neopixel LED and RGB values on the serial monitor. My inspiration was based on a wall paint app which allows you to take any colour from a picture and make it into the paint for home decorating.

To start, I started wiring with crocodile clips to ensure that I made no mistakes in soldering. With the code, I used example codes from the libraries to see whether my wiring and my colour sensor work. Then, I started to modify and put those examples together to make my code. 

One of the problems Iâ€™ve had whilst coding was making the colours (specifically green) more intense. To overcome this, I multiplied RGB colours by 1.8. Another problem that I had when the wiring was figuring out how to connect the colour sensor and Neopixel.

To further improve the project, I would have added an LCD screen to show what HEX colour is shown and possibly the name of the colour as well. I could also display other colours that complement the colour well. This could benefit people who are in the process of decorating their homes.
